Devops Project
Create a web hook in GITLAB, once code is pushed by developer it will run a Jenkins Job. Which will pull the code from GitLab Repository and first deploy the code local workspave, prepare the docker iamge by pulling it from Docker Hub and then running the code on a UAT Server(slave-1). Once the build is successfull another job will run and perform all the steps for deploying the container and code in production server(slave-2)
